# Flutter_Dev

1. A basic Flutter application implementing **Reactive and SingleTon** Design pattern which includes:
   - API calls
   - EventStream
   - Card Design
   - Json Parsing
  
2. The application is completely offline. No need to connect to the internet to fetch data. All JSON responses can be found in the ‘assets/json’ folder.

3. There is no online database system. So a data structure(List)in SharedPreferences which acts as a local database. When the app is launched for thefirst time, It gets initialized with one user with email, first name, last name, phone numberand password (which is encrypted using bCrypt).
